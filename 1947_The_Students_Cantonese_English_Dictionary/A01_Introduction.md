INTRODUCTION
===================

The need of a Cantonese - English dictionary has, for the past ten years, been so keenly felt among foreign students of the language that no apology is required for the appearance of this volume, though it were highly desirable that it have been done by those better qualified than the compilers.

It was undertaken only from a sense of duty, when there seemed no prospect that anyone else was going to supply the need, and in the midst of other pressing duties.The user will,
therefore, kindly judge with leniency the inaccuracies and deficiencies that he finds in it.

The dictionary contains some 10,000 characters, and is really a combination of colloquial dictionary and brief lexicon of literary terms. The characters used in the spoken language are set out in the margin and illustrated by examples of use, while those of the written or literary language do not receive such a prominent position, and have very short definitions in italics with no illustrations of use. In giving examples an attempt has been made to choose those which best illustrate the various uses of a word and will, at the same time, be useful to the students while those whose meaning is obvious have been avoided as far as possible. Occasionally, however, both these and less common examples have been given in order to illustrate the various uses and meanings of a word. Obviously, only a fraction of the possible combinations could be included in a book of this size, which was made rather for those who prefer portability to completeness. If the examples might frequently been better chosen we can only crave the indulgence of the critic.

For those students who like to use a dictionary for study as well as for reference it is recommended that each new word or phrase met with in reading be checked off as it is looked up in this dictionary. Those which are not found here may be written in the margin, which has been left wide for this purpose. In memorizing, one may concentrate on those checked or written in, thus avoiding much waste of time and effort. This makes the dictionary valuable for review work, which is one of the secrets of learning Chinese.

It is felt that, with the literary words which it includes,this dictionary is sufficiently complete to take the student up a point where he can use one of the several very valuable native dictionaries, either entirely in Chinese or Chinese-English.

The compilers will be glad to have their attention called to any inaccuracies that may be found in this book, and to receive criticisms or suggestions which might make a future edition more useful to the student of the Cantonese language.
